# Kubernetes Adoption Journey

Hands-on tutorial for going from day-1 to production on DigitalOcean Kubernetes.

Main documentation is available at [digitalocean.github.io/k8s-adoption-journey](https://digitalocean.github.io/k8s-adoption-journey/).

## Background

Kubernetes is a complex system that requires hard work and dedication. In fact, when it comes to using Kubernetes, the best value comes from adopting a DevOps culture. Kubernetes isn’t just installing something on a virtual machine (VM), it’s a transformative way of viewing IT and enabling your teams. Increased automation is a must to increase productivity. With Kubernetes, every aspect of your applications and tools can be made accessible to Kubernetes automation, including role-based access controls, ports, databases, storage, networking, automated container builds, automated security scanning, and more. Kubernetes gives teams a well-documented and proven system that they can use to automate so that they can focus on outcomes.
